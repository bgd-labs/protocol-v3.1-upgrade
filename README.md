# Protocol v 3.1 Upgrade

The repository contains contracts for upgrade existing instances of Aave protocol from v3.0.2 to v3.1.0.

## PoolInstanceWithCustomInitialize
Extends `PoolInstance` contract, includes initialization of the Virtual Accounting values on all existing reserves.

The logic to calculate this value is:
```
  (aTokenTotalSupply + accruedToTreasury) - (sTokenTotalSupply + vTokenTotalSupply)
```
Where `accruedToTreasury` is amount of fees accrued, but not minted as aToken at the moment of execution.
To avoid the situation when balance of underlying is lower than virtual accounting,
it's possible because aave generates certain imprecision overtime, we cap virtual accounting value to this value.

Virtual balance for GHO is not enabled, because it has custom implementation and getting minted on the borrow event.
